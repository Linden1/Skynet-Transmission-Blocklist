# Skynet_Blocklist
For Assuwrt-Merlin routers running transmission
I wanted my own list because I want to run transmission via Entware and the default skynet blocklist was too restrictive - especially as far as eastern europe is concerned. I'll be updating manually for now and adding lists that work for ME.
